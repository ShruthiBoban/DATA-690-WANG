    "Renewable energy is collected from renewable resources which can be used repeatedly which leads to a positive life cycle of a human being. The goal of Historic Clean Energy Grant Program was to increase the amount of renewable energy generated in Maryland.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue is important as the increase in the usage of renewable energy leads into less global warming and improves public health and by these awards, the increase in renewable energies were possible.\n",

    "   Which renewable energy project has been implemented more over the years? \n",

    "To find out which renewable energy has got the highest project cost, I need to have the energies (Technology unit) and the total project cost. To find out if the Award Amount increases or decreases every year. I need to have Year and Award Amount.\n",
