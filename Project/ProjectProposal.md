# Deliverable #1 - Project Proposal in Markdown format

## What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
Renewable energy is collected from renewable resources which can be used repeatedly which leads to a positive life cycle of a human being. The goal of Historic Clean Energy Grant Program was to increase the amount of renewable energy generated in Maryland.

## Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
This issue is important as the increase in the usage of renewable energy leads into less global warming and improves public health and by these awards, the increase in renewable energies were possible.

## What questions do you have in mind and wouyld like to answer?
I have few hypothesis in mind which are: 1. I think that GeoThermal energy has got highest project cost over the years as wind and solar eneries are cheaper than any other form of energy
2. I think that the award amount increases yearly becuase if people are encouraged to re-use the renewable energy by providing award amount, then it might lead to less global warming being a good cause for the public

## Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
Data Source : https://opendata.maryland.gov/Energy-and-Environment/Historic-Clean-Energy-Grant-Awards/4jem-ugpy/data
Data Source discovered from : https://umbc.app.box.com/notes/375877568053?s=inwbinsctcmedcknp7h8r3tm1das5vs9 . I was trying to check on data from different places like chicago, new york and maryland which finally led me to the link (https://opendata.maryland.gov/) thus ended up finding the data source.
