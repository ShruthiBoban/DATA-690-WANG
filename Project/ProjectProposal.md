# Deliverable #1 - Project Proposal in Markdown format

## What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
Renewable energy is collected from renewable resources which can be used repeatedly which leads to a positive life cycle of a human being. The goal of Historic Clean Energy Grant Program was to increase the amount of renewable energy generated in Maryland.

## Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
This issue is important as the increase in the usage of renewable energy leads into less global warming and improves public health and by these awards, the increase in renewable energies were possible.

## What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
1. Which renewable energy project has been implemented more over the years? 
2. Whether the Award Amount increases or decreases every year?
3. Is there a particular areas that have more projects (# of project, and/or total spending)?

## Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
Data Source : https://opendata.maryland.gov/Energy-and-Environment/Historic-Clean-Energy-Grant-Awards/4jem-ugpy/data

Data Source discovered from : https://umbc.app.box.com/notes/375877568053?s=inwbinsctcmedcknp7h8r3tm1das5vs9 . I was trying to check on data from different places like chicago, new york and maryland which finally led me to the link (https://opendata.maryland.gov/) thus ended up finding the data source.

Number of Rows in the dataset : 12988 
Number of columns in the dataset : 18 
Data Size : 3.27MB

## What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units do you expect to analyze?
I  am planning to analyze Total Project Cost, Award Date, Technology, Award Amount. I might roughly use 4 to 5 units for analysing.

## What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis? 
To find out which renewable energy has got the highest project cost, I need to have the energies (Technology unit) and the total project cost.
To find out if the Award Amount increases or decreases every year. I need to have Year and Award Amount.

## What kinds of techniques do you you plan to use (for example, summary statistics, scatter plot, bar chart, chi-squared test)?
I plan to use summary statistics, histograms, bar chart. I would also like to improvise my analysis when I am actually working on it.
