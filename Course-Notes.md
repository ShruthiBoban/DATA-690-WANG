## We learnt how to launch interactive shell in [https://www.python.org/] and work on Terminal, create a .py, .ipynb and .md files in [https://notebooks.ai/] 
## We also created a github account and created a test repository.
## Below are the few basic syntax used while working on .md files

# Basic Syntax

Bold - **bold text**
Italic - *italicized text*
Blockquote - > blockquote
Ordered List - 1. First Item, 2. Second Item, 3. Third Item
Uordered List -  - First Item, - Second Item, - Third Item
Code - `code`

## Kinds of Data
1. Tabular or spreadsheet
2. Multidimensional arrays (matrices)
3. Multiple tables of data interrelated by key columns
4. Evenly or unevenly spaced time series

## Essential Python Libraries
1. Numpy : NumPy, short for Numerical Python, has long been a cornerstone of numerical computing in Python. It provides the data structures, algorithms, and library glue needed for most scientific applications involving numerical data in Python
2. Pandas : pandas provides high-level data structures and functions designed to make working with structured or tabular data fast, easy, and expressive. The primary objects in pandas that will be used in this book are the DataFrame, a tabular, column-oriented data structure with both row and column labels, and the Series, a one-dimensional labeled array object.
3. Matplotlib : matplotlib is the most popular Python library for producing plots and other twodimensional data visualizations. It is designed for creating plots suitable for publication.
4. SciPy : SciPy is a collection of packages addressing a number of different standard problem domains in scientific computing.
5. Scikit-learn : scikit-learn has become the premier generalpurpose machine learning toolkit for Python programmers.
6. Statsmodels : statsmodels is a statistical analysis package that was seeded by work from Stanford University statistics professor Jonathan Taylor, who implemented a number of regression analysis models popular in the R programming language

## Installation and Setup with different Operating Systems
1. Windows
2. Apple
3. GNU/Linux
